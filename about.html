                <p>Our little family started out as a tiny bakery from home.</p>
                <p>The owner of the restaurant Kelly, began her journey when she was very young, baking goodies at home and selling them at school to her classmates. Later on she began to advertise her baked good along with meals to her community to expand her venture. Once she had saved up enough money, she invested in renting out a small shop which has now become her restaurants home. We have roughly 15 employees as the restaurant is still rather small, however as it continues to grow, we will be on the hunt for a much larger area to rent and possibly purchase to create a solid home for our little family as it expands. We do hope you will join us on this exciting adventure!</p>

                <h3>Our History</h3>
                <p>Kelly's Kitchen was established in 2018 when our founder Kelly Thompson turned her passion for baking into a small home business. What started as weekend bake sales quickly grew into a catering service for local events. In 2020, despite the challenges of the pandemic, we opened our first brick-and-mortar location in Kempton Park, offering takeaway services that became a neighborhood favorite. By 2022, we expanded to full-service dining, creating the warm and inviting space you experience today.</p>
